# Problem Statement #

Diabetes is among critical diseases and lots of people are suffering from this disease. Age, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary diabetes, living style, bad diet, high blood pressure, etc. can cause Diabetes. People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc. Current practice in hospitals is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis. Healthcare industries have large volume databases.. In existing method, the classification and prediction accuracy is not so high. In this case study, we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Classification accuracy is boosted with new dataset compared to existing dataset. Further with imposed a pipeline model for diabetes prediction intended towards improving the accuracy of classification.

# Dataset Collection #

This  module  includes  data  collection  and  understanding  the  data  to  study  the  patterns  and  trends  which  helps  in  prediction and evaluating the results. Dataset description is given below- This Diabetes dataset contains 2000 records and 9 attributes.
Following are the attribute for dataset:
* Pregnancies 
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age
* Outcome

Outcome is the dependent variable and all others are independent variables
